(Ad-hoc method) This is the finished process on how to use terminal command -xcodebuild to export an ipa without having an Apple Developer account. The original tutorial was from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39674237/xcrun-command-to-export-ipa-file-xcode8-for-iphoneos10-0. Full credit goes to robita, who wrote the partly finished answer that inspired me to finish it.
Let's Start!
Make an Xcode project and call it Test. Create a new plist file called exportOptions.plist. Under root, there is a line that says new item. On the right side, paste this code in.
<xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8">
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <key>method</key>
    <string>ad-hoc</string>
    <key>teamID</key>
    <string>YOUR_TEAM_ID</string>
    <key>uploadBitcode</key>
    <true/>
    <key>uploadSymbols</key>
    <true/>
  </dict>
</plist>
Don't worry about the coding errors. It works.
Archive your app, and click "Show in Finder" when the application Organizer is opened.
Rename the xcarchive to something more simple, without any spaces. Move the archive to an empty folder in anywhere you want (Desktop, Documents.) 
Also move the exportOptions.plist in that folder too. Now, fire up Terminal. Copy and paste the code below. 
xcodebuild -exportArchive
-archivePath ~/YOUR NEW FOLDER'S DIRECTORY/YOUR NEW FOLDER/YOUR ARCHIVE NAME (IF YOUR ARCHIVE NAME HAS SPACES INSIDE OF IT THEN YOU WILL HAVE TO DO SOMEHTING ELSE)
-exportPath ~/YOUR NEW FOLDER'S DIRECTORY/YOUR NEW FOLDER/MAKE UP A NAME FOR ANOTHER FOLDER WHERE THE IPA WILL BE STORED
-exportOptionsPlist ~/YOUR NEW FOLDER'S DIRECTORY/YOUR NEW FOLDER/THE EXPORTOPTIONS.PLIST FILE
Edit the UPPERCASE letters to your own "preference."
